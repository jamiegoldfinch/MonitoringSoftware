I've got the keylogger working now. I've decided to do a date header at the start. Then just to log everything.

# Keeping it running
- So far, both services restart when I try to close them down.

# Keylog strokes that need fixing
- 




# things to do:
- Get the keylogger and watchdog to restart if stopped unexpectedly.
- Go over the keylogging process and make sure that the keys are logged properly and not some CAPS LEFT or stuff like that.
- Organise emailing to the accountability partner. I'll need to think about when and how to send it
- I'd like to monitor pages for key words.
- I'd like to incorporate snapshots of the pages. When would I take the snapshots?
