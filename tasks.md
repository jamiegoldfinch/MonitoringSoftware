I've got the keylogger working now. I've decided to do a date header at the start. Then just to log everything.

# Keeping it running
- So far, when I open task manager and I close one service, it successfully logs to the keylog.txt that the service has been stopped. 
  Whether that be the keylogger or the watchdog. They both keep each other accountable.
- Now I just need to restart both services straight away. I think the main functionality is in the main.js file.

# Keylog strokes that need fixing
- 




# things to do:
- Get the keylogger and watchdog to restart if stopped unexpectedly.
- Go over the keylogging process and make sure that the keys are logged properly and not some CAPS LEFT or stuff like that.
- Organise emailing to the accountability partner. I'll need to think about when and how to send it
- I'd like to monitor pages for key words.
- I'd like to incorporate snapshots of the pages. When would I take the snapshots?
