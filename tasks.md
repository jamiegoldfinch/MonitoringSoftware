# THINGS TO GET DONE WITH THE SOFTWARE
- Go over the keylogging process and make sure that the keys are logged properly and not some CAPS LEFT or stuff like that.
- Organise emailing to the accountability partner. I'll need to think about when and how to send it
- I'd like to monitor pages for key words.
- I'd like to incorporate snapshots of the pages. When would I take the snapshots?



# SUCCESSES
- It now runs continuously and restarts if it was stopped.
- The keylogger text looks pretty good and doesn't look like gibberish.



# Keylog strokes that need fixing
-
